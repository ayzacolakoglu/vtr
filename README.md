This project aims to investigate how serial dependence emerges in changing environments by extending computational models of perceptual inference and focus on how individuals adapt their priors when environmental dynamics shift and how these adaptations explain variability in perceptual biases.

Intended Objectives:

-  Investigate how prior beliefs about temporal continuity influence perceptual biases.
-  Compare different Bayesian updating mechanisms (static vs. iterative) in explaining observed variations in serial dependence.
-  Validate the model using experimental data to assess its predictive accuracy.
-  Explore individual differences in implicit beliefs about temporal continuity.
